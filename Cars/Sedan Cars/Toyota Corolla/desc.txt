Everybody has a Toyota Corolla story. This compact car made Toyota a household brand in the U.S. well before there was a Camry, a RAV4 or a Tacoma, making a name for itself with its dependability, fuel efficiency and practicality. Those traits continue to define the modern Toyota Corolla, which gets numerous updates for the 2023 model year.
