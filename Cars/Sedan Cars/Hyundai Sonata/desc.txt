The Sonata has the aura of a more expensive vehicle. It's stylish and it overdelivers in key areas, including its great-looking and easy-to-use infotainment system display, cool parking camera system and long warranty coverage. But in other areas, the Sonata merely matches what you'd expect from a midsize sedan, and it falters slightly when it comes to ride quality and seat comfort.
