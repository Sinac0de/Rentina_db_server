The Audi A6 provides excellent performance and plenty of the latest technology features. Comfort suffers ever so slightly when you go with the big optional wheels and sport suspension, but the upside is a vehicle that's classy to look at and very fun to drive. It's one of the best models available in the midsize luxury sedan class.
