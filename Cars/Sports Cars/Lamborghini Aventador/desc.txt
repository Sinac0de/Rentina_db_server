In production for over a decade, the Lamborghini Aventador has reached the end of its long and winding road. To celebrate the model's success, the 2022 Aventador comes only in new LP 780-4 Ultimae specification, its sonorous 6.5-liter V12 engine now equipped with titanium intake valves to make the Ultimae the most powerful example of the supercar ever made.
