The Golf is dated but not without positive attributes. It has exceptional ride quality, a quiet interior and excellent fuel economy. And thanks to its well-matched 1.4-liter engine and eight-speed automatic, the Golf is an enjoyable daily companion. But the lack of optional features, downmarket interior plastics and mediocre tires ultimately make the Golf less desirable than more well-rounded competitors.
