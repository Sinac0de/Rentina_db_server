The Kia Soul has a lot going for it. Its boxy shape gives it a seriously roomy passenger cabin and cargo area. It's also fun to drive, with above-average handling abilities and an intuitive continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Minor grievances aside, this small SUV offers solid value for the money and is one of the best compacts out there.
