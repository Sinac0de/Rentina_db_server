No other American sedan has the same combination of performance, comfort and muscle car style as the Charger. Acceleration is quick and the brakes are reassuringly strong, but the vague steering feel and the suspension's sensitivity to midcorner bumps hamper overall handling. Scores for convenience and utility are also middling.
