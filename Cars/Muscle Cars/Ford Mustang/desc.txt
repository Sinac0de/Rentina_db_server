The redesigned 2024 Ford Mustang introduces the seventh generation of the pony car, though much of the previous Mustang's DNA is still present. The new car rides on the same platform and uses the same engines (all with slight modifications), meaning that the new Mustang drives similarly to the outgoing model.
